\section{Business Rules}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Cory should be on when the car starts}
	\item{Cory should detect if the driver is going over the speed limit and advise the driver to decelerate}
	\item{Cory should detect if there is a car in front that is too close to the driver and advise the driver to decelerate}
	\item{Cory should detect if the driver is steering into another lane and advise the driver to steer back into their lane}
	\item{Cory should detect if there are cars that are too close to the sides of the car and advise the driver to steer left or right accordingly}
	\item{Cory should detect if visibility is too low and advise the driver to pull over}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State Transitions}
\subsubsection{Start (S)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{If car is going over speed limit, go to DEC}
	\item{If there is a car too close in front of the car, go to DEC}
	\item{If the car is steering towards the left lane, go to SR}
	\item{If the car is steering towards the right lane, go to SL}
	\item{If there is a car too close to the left side of the car, go to SR}
	\item{If there is a car too close to the right side of the car, go to SL}
	\item{If visibility is too low, go to PO} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Decelerate (DEC)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{If the car is still over the speed limit, stay in DEC}
	\item{If the car in front is still too close, stay in DEC}
	\item{Else, go back to S}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Steer Left (SL)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{If the car is still steering towards the right, stay in SL}
	\item{If the car on the right is still too close, stay in SL}
	\item{Else, go back to S}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Steer Right (SR)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{If the car is still steering towards the left, stay in SR}
	\item{If the car on the left is still too close, stay in SR}
	\item{Else, go back to S}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pull Over (PO)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{If the car has not pulled over and visibility is still too low, stay in PO}
	\item{Else, go back to S}
